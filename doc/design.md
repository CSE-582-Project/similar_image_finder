## User Stories
1. John is an end user. They want to find products that match their fashion sense. They want an easy to use and simple interface. Their skill level is minimal and their job does not involve any technical skills.
2. Jonah is a machine learning engineer. They want to train the neural network model component, test the model and save it. They want a neural net that is easy to train and retrain. They also want the outputs of the model to make sense. They have technical knowledge of machine learning.
3. Jameson is a merchant. They want to add thier products so that they get recognized. They want an easy to use interface to upload their products. They have minimal techincal skills.
4. JuniorMart is a company. They want to use this software for recommending their own products. They want the software to be modular so that they can easily integrate it on their platform. They have highly skilled engineers that are skilled in integration. 

## Use Cases
1. Customer/End user will upload the image of a fashion product on the GUI. The software will pull up similar images from its database to the uploaded image.
2. A merchant will upload images of his products on the GUI. The software will upload these images to its database and create an alert to notify the Machine learning engineer that new data has been uploaded. The GUI will also give a confirmation to the merchant.
3. Machine Learning engineer will append the new images in the dataset used for training and train and test a new model. They will also deploy the most recent model.
